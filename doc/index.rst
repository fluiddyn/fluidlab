FluidLab documentation
======================

FluidLab is a framework for studying fluid dynamics by experiments
using Python.  It is part of the wider project `FluidDyn
<http://fluiddyn.readthedocs.org>`_.

The project is still in a planning stage so it is still pretty
unstable and many of its planned features have not yet been
implemented.
